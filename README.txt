Parsec Portable
---------------

This archive contains all of the subcomponents of a Parsec installation on Windows:

1. The root directory of the archive contains appdata.json, parsecd.exe, the parsecd-XXX-XX.dll SDK & app bundle, and this document. If these files are put together in the same directory, Parsec will operate in "portable" mode, confining itself to the directory where parsecd.exe is run from. The normal Parsec installation installs parsecd.exe to "Program Files" and uses the current user's %APPDATA% directory (usually Users\YOU\AppData\Roaming\) for the Parsec SDK and app bundle.

2. The "service" directory contains pservice.exe, the Parsec System Service required to elevate the parsecd.exe application so it can interact with the secure desktop. This is necessary to remotely access UAC prompts.

3. The "wscripts" directory contains various scripts used by the Parsec installer to install the System Service, Windows Firewall rules, and the ViGEm virtual gamepad driver.

4. The "vigem" directory contains the ViGEm virtual gamepad driver used by Parsec.
